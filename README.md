Project Outline: 
Create a an expression manager that properly identifies infix expressions and translates them into postfix expressions
Create a working queue

Instructions Expression Manager: 
1) Run the project
2) Enter any infix expression
3) Once done, click x

Instructions Queue:
1) Run the project
2) Automatically implements queue

Assumptions: 
- Since the queue and infix tasks were extremely different that each have their own cpp, header, and output files/images.
- Queue does not request user input and therefore uses an example main.cpp file for ease of use

Output Images:
